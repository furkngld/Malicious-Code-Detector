# Malicious Code Detector

A powerful Python tool for detecting potentially malicious or obfuscated code in files and directories. This scanner helps security researchers, developers, and system administrators identify suspicious code patterns, encoded/encrypted content, and possible malware indicators.

## üîç Features

- Detects various types of suspicious code:
  - Base64 encoded content
  - Hex encoded strings
  - Compressed/gzipped data
  - High entropy data (possible encryption)
  - Obfuscated code patterns
  
- Comprehensive scanning options:
  - Single file analysis
  - Full directory recursive scanning
  - Drag-and-drop interface for Windows users
  - Interactive console menu
  
- Smart file handling:
  - Automatically skips binary files
  - Configurable file type exclusions
  - Maximum file size limits
  
- User-friendly interface:
  - Color-coded output for easy reading
  - Detailed findings reports
  - Error handling and reporting

## üìã Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Required packages:
  - colorama
  - python-magic (for UNIX/Linux) or python-magic-bin (for Windows)

## üöÄ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/furkngld/malicious-code-detector.git
cd malicious-code-detector
```

2. Install required packages:
```bash
# For Windows
pip install colorama python-magic-bin

# For Linux/MacOS
pip install colorama python-magic
```

## üíª Usage

### Interactive Mode

Run the script without arguments to use the interactive menu:

```bash
python detect.py
```

This will display a menu with the following options:
1. Scan File
2. Scan Directory
3. Help
4. Exit

### Command Line Interface

Scan a specific file:
```bash
python detect.py path/to/suspicious_file.js
```

Scan an entire directory:
```bash
python detect.py path/to/directory
```

### Additional Options

Customize ignored extensions:
```bash
python detect.py path/to/scan --ignore=".jpg,.png,.mp3"
```

Set maximum file size (in MB):
```bash
python detect.py path/to/scan --max-size=20
```

### Windows Drag-and-Drop

In Windows environments, you can simply drag and drop files or folders onto the script executable to scan them with default settings.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How it Works

The tool employs multiple detection techniques to identify suspicious code:

1. **Pattern Matching**: Uses regex patterns to identify common obfuscation techniques
2. **Entropy Analysis**: Detects high-entropy segments that may indicate encryption
3. **Encoding Detection**: Identifies base64, hex, and other common encoding methods
4. **Compression Detection**: Finds compressed data embedded in text files
5. **Heuristic Analysis**: Examines code for suspicious patterns and techniques commonly used by malware

## üõ°Ô∏è Use Cases

- Scanning downloaded code before execution
- Auditing web applications for security issues
- Checking user-submitted content for malicious code
- Validating open-source packages
- Forensic analysis of potentially compromised systems
